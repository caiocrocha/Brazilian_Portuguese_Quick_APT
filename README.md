# Brazilian Quick APT: Quick Automatic Phonetic Transcription for Brazilian Portuguese

Our Open Source APT model for Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR) phonetic transcription is readily available to use from the Hugging Face repository or from the command line. We also share a dataset of phonetic transcriptions for training an APT model for PT-BR, generated automatically with FalaBrasil's G2P from the CORAA ASR corpus.
